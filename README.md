## Project Hub

For now this is a Project Hub. Please feel free to send up projects and have them hosted here (as long as we talked before hand). This could become the biggest repository of user-first software.

# Sparchunu Project

Many people don't understand the need for new projects to replace the old. For instance. we have the current foundation of the GNU/Linux community. The Linux part is great for the everyday user, but the GNU design language is oudated and old, meaning that people look at it as if it was from the nineties. Hence... the Sparchunu Project was born.

# This is the UNL Kernel. The Undeniably Not Linux Kernel.
The UNL Kernel was brought to life because of the lack of features from the Linux Kernel. It was missing so many things the average user needed. So... I decided to take this route to build a new kernel for mainstream users. By relying on large corporations to solve our problems, we are asking for them to not get solved, as Linux is server-side. So, one day I decided to fork the Linux Kernel... sort of. I decided to clone the Linux Kernel, but with a Hybrid Kernel Model. More about a Hybrid Kernel here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel. I saw a need and decided to take it upon myself to make a change.

# Sparchunu Operating System (Community Name Needed)

The Sparchunu Operating System (as it is called for now) is a community-first operating system. Meaning: It is built by the community, maintained by the community, and used by the community. The goal with the Sparchunu Operating system was to replace the current operating systems on the market with something just as capable, generally compatible, and easy-to-use.

Here is why I decided to bring it into existence: Linux doesn't have the compatibility it needs. Microsoft Windows doesn't have the testing it needs. Mac OS is a telemetry machine made to make Apple large sums of money. So what are we suposed to do? Build it ourself? Well, yes.

# Sparchunu Operating System

# SOAP

So Another Project is an exact copy of the Android Open Source Project codebase, as it is vital that we secure the mobile freedoms of users. I don't think I want my carrier constantly surveying everything I talk about on my phone, and I doubt you do either. The primary difference between SOAP and AOSP is that the SOAP project is made for the community to maintain, whereas the AOSP project is primarily maintained by organizations.

# Browser Replacements

Current browsers have great features, but performance has begun to grow sluggish in this space. So, I have been working on reducing memory usage, while improving performance on Chromium-based, Firefox-based browsers.

# Optimized Chromium Browser

Due to how large the codebase is for Chromium browsers, it is rediculously hard to optimize it for performance, so I have stripped out many portions that are "Google-chrome-centric" and made it where it works with far less ram, and still contain sign-in capability when required.

# Optimized Firefox Browser

People don't realize it, but Firefox does use similar codebase to chromium or part of their browser. I have gone through and ripped out pieces which were unnecessary, while also improving the speed and usability of the browser.

# A New Browser - Rydon

Rydon, a new browser built on a custom engine (as seen below). It is meant to work faster than chromium or firefox, while also keeping similar functionality. This browser was designed by me so that I could have something that fit my needs. I decided to modify it a bit and then begin work on a public version of the browser. 

# New Browser Kit (with chroimum and gecko engine compatibilities)

I have taken upon myself to replace the outdated portions of browsers with something new, sleek, and outright fast capabilities. No more of this eight gigabytes of ram for a brower to function. Instead, you can use four and still have the same capabilities.


# A Quick Thank You - 

I would like to thank the Chromium Project, Mozzilla, as well as the community for keeping the codebase's alive. This has allowed for me to build something new in a fraction of the time that I thought it would take. I will continue to do my best, so thank you.

# A Need for Assistance

For those that understand the grand scheme of these projects, you must guess that I don't sleep. Well... i do. I just don't sleep a lot. i am in need of other contributors to keep these projects going (or built in some cases) as these projects do not bring funding it for me to live my daily life. I want to bring forth a world where we can use our computers as we wish, and in order for that to happen, it can't just be me.

I thank each of your's willing to work and help make the computing experience a whole lot better,
